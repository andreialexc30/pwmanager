<h1>About the project</h1>
Browser based password managing system for all your passwording needs. Work in progress as of 19/5/2021
<h2>Description</h2>
This project has been created with HTML5/CSS3 & the SASS preprocessor along with vanilla JS. It's a simple system that allows you to generate passwords, name them and store them in your browser's local storage. Best used if you need multiple passwords and have trouble at memorizing them or need more complex passwords to secure your accounts. Although I understand that the web browser's local storage isn't the most secure way of keeping your passwords, this project serves the purpose of showcasing my web manipulation abilities. In the future I might update it to a proper system where passwords are stored in a database with encryption along with pagination for more display capacity.
